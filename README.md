# Video Game Store API (Spring Boot, Java, MySQL) 🎮

This project is a Video-Game-Store REST API for an e-commerce platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I worked within an existing codebase to debug, extend, and harden backend functionality, focusing on correctness, security, and test coverage.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project strengthened my ability to work inside an existing Spring Boot application, debug real issues, and extend functionality safely. I gained hands-on experience with JWT auth, role-based authorization, database-backed features, and validating behavior with automated API tests.

## 🔍 Interesting Code: Fixing Duplicate Products on Update

One of the most interesting issues I worked on was resolving a bug that caused updating a product (such as a video game) to create duplicate records in the database instead of modifying the existing entry.

This fix was exciting to me because it required understanding both the controller and DAO behavior, and it reinforced how small backend mistakes can lead to serious data issues if not caught.
